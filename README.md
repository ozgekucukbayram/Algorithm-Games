## 🧠 Algorithms & Games

### 🩷 1. Selection Sort – *Selection Sort Dance*
- **Goal:** Sort 7 shuffled cards by selecting the smallest unsorted number and placing it in correct order.
- **Complexity:** O(n²)
- **Scoring:** `100 - 10 × (Swaps - IdealSwaps)` (min: 0)
- **Time Limit:** 5 minutes
- **Mechanics:** Step-by-step swap visualization with randomized card start

### 💼 2. Greedy Algorithm – *Treasure Hunt*
- **Goal:** Maximize total value by selecting items into a 15kg backpack using the value/weight ratio.
- **Complexity:** O(n log n) (Fractional Knapsack)
- **Scoring:** `(Player Value / Max Greedy Value) × 100` (rounded)
- **Time Limit:** 5 minutes
- **Mechanics:** Random item weights/values, strategic decision-making

### 🔍 3. Binary Search – *Guess the Number*
- **Goal:** Find a secret number between 1 and 100 in as few steps as possible.
- **Complexity:** O(log n)
- **Scoring:** `100 - 10 × (Steps - 7)` (ideal: 7 steps)
- **Time Limit:** 5 minutes
- **Mechanics:** Each guess halves the search space
