# 🎮 Learning Algorithms With Games

Welcome to **Learning Algorithms With Games**, a gamified teaching tool created as part of the SEN4012 - Analysis of Algorithms course at İstanbul Kültür University.

This project was developed by the **Binary Blossoms** team to help students better understand algorithmic concepts like **Bubble Sort**, **Greedy Algorithm**, and **Binary Search** through engaging, interactive games.

## 🧠 Algorithms Implemented

### 🩷 1. Bubble Sort – *Bubble Dance*
- **Goal:** Sort shuffled cards using only adjacent swaps.
- **Scoring:** `100 - 10 × (Swaps - IdealSwaps)`
- **Time Limit:** 5 minutes

### 💼 2. Greedy Algorithm – *Treasure Hunt*
- **Goal:** Maximize item value under a 15kg backpack limit.
- **Scoring:** `(Player Value / Greedy Max) × 100`
- **Time Limit:** 5 minutes

### 🔍 3. Binary Search – *Guess the Number*
- **Goal:** Guess the number 1–100 using minimal steps.
- **Scoring:** `100 - 10 × (Steps - IdealSteps)`
- **Ideal Steps:** 7 (log₂(100))
